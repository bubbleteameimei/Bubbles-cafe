    The mind plays tricks in the darkness. Reality seems to bend and shift,
    leaving me questioning my own sanity. The therapist's office feels different today,

    Every moment brought new horrors as my body betrayed me.

    architecture defying euclidean geometry. The eldritch knowledge contained within
    those forbidden tomes threatened to shatter my fragile grasp on reality.
